Guepard: a library for Gaussian Process Ensembles
================================================================

Guepard aims at making Gaussian Process (GP) models faster and amenable to large datasets up to a few million points. It relies on ensembles of GP models where the sub-models are trained on subsets of the data. It is built on top of Tensorflow_ / GPflow_ and implements various rules for aggregating the sub-model predictions into a single distribution:

* Equivalent Observation as described in the AISTATS submission
* Nested GPs [Rulli√®re 2018]
* Barycenter GP [Cohen 2020]
* Several classic baselines: (generalised) Product of Expert, (robust) Bayesian committee machine, etc.
